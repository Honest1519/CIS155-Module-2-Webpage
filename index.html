            <h2>Facts about Jelly</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We have <b>no idea</b> how old he is.</li>
                <li>We got him from the humane society.</li>
                <li>He is  <em>clingy</em>.</li>
                <li>He's grey with short fur.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>He is one of many</h3>
            <p>Seriously- we have 4 cats. They are Peanut Butter, Jelly, Loaf (don't ask), and Pumpkin. Everytime my mom says we're not getting another cat, it's a sure sign another one will show up.</p>
            <h4>He is <em>SUPER</em> attached to me</h4>
            <p>He will not leave me alone. He follows me around the house. For some reason, Jelly chose me as the person to hang out with every day.</p>
